# airbase-project
Mini projects and main project for my third year subject called Design and Analysis of Information Systems



## MP 1
MP_1 is the first mini-project from the course. It's purpose is to create a basic class structure which demonstrates the appropriate implementation of different types of attributes, as well as implementation of class extent and persistance. 

The attributes demonstrated in MP_1 are:

- Complex attribute
- Optional attribute
- Multi-value attribute
- Class attribute
- Derrived attribute

Additionally, the program represents some method behaviour:

- Class method
- Method overriding and overloading
